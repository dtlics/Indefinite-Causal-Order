# Verification scope

Repository organization preserves the distinction between mathematical claims, exact finite checks, computational diagnostics, and a formal proof audit.

| Component | Current evidence and reproducibility |
| --- | --- |
| Research ownership | `python scripts/validate_repo.py` checks canonical result owners, generated indexes, and local links |
| Paper | The selected source compiles in two pdfLaTeX passes to 19 pages, with no undefined references or overfull/underfull boxes; pages 1, 7, 17, and 18 were visually sampled |
| Overleaf export | `python scripts/package_overleaf.py` deterministically packages the exact `paper/main.tex` bytes |
| Selected Lean source | `python proofs/lean/verify_integrity.py` compares 1,651 modules and entry/configuration files to the recorded verification fingerprints |
| Lean rebuild and kernel audit | See [current proof-verification record](../proofs/lean/audit/README.md) and [rebuild instructions](../proofs/lean/README.md) |
| Exact P3 certificates | `python proofs/lean/certificates/verify_all.py` replays the independent support and sparse separation identities using exact arithmetic |
| P1 | The consolidated proof compiles; exact rational matrix generation and the source manifest check pass. The arbitrary-ancilla claim is analytical, not established by finite sampling |
| P2 | `verify_p2.py --all` passes four certificate replays and eleven exact structural checks; these do not settle the unrestricted optimum or finite attainment |
| RG | The source package documents integrity and certificate tiers, including [supporting helpers absent from the supplied material](../research/topics/rg-routed-graph/source/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) |
| C6 scalar checks | The exact-arithmetic replay checks both the paper's `212/10000` estimate and the formal `215/10000` allowance; it does not replace the shared-Haar proof |

The paper compilation used MiKTeX 25.12. Shell escape was disabled; its related warning and an update reminder do not affect the required build. The visual sample covers four pages, not a complete visual review or an online Overleaf run. The source checksum is `7aafc806fa3573757f3e3a73ffb3476a770ca1928aac17fb2371829f2a43a33a`.

The selected proof-verification record reports 32 endpoints checked with Lean 4.30.0 at trust level zero, using compiled objects matched to the selected sources. It does not claim a second clean elaboration of every module. A new full Lean rebuild or kernel audit was not performed as part of repository consolidation. Source fingerprints and finite Python replays do not replace that audit.

`prepare_verification.py` derives the current import closure and endpoint list offline. It rejects missing local modules and dependency cycles; the wrappers also check endpoint identities and allowed axioms. Their offline checks are separate from running Lean.

Current evidence belongs with the claim it supports. When source changes, rerun relevant checks and update the corresponding record in place after success. Keep temporary output under `_build/`; normal Git history preserves prior versions. Do not preserve intermediate build logs or repeated checkpoint reports as alternate research records.
